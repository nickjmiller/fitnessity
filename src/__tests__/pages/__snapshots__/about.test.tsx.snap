          Fitnessity has origins dating back to 2016, when the founders explored the idea of providing quality workout information through digital means. Since the beginning, the team at Fitnessity knew how important it was for people to have access to information that could simplify the journey to a healthier lifestyle. What we strive to offer is information that can help individuals properly execute a workout movement, backed by science, in order to improve their life through physical activity and exercise.
